## Description

The FCK Triangle EA is designed to identify and execute triangular arbitrage trades in the forex market. Triangular arbitrage takes advantage of price discrepancies between three currency pairs to generate profits.

The code starts by declaring global variables for currency pairs, start time, and end time. The `triangularArbitrageStrategy()` function is then defined to identify suitable currency pairs for triangular arbitrage. The strategy loops through all possible combinations of currency pairs and calculates the potential profit for each combination. If a profit is greater than 0, the `placeTrade()` function is called to execute the trade.

The `calculateProfit()` function calculates the potential profit from triangular arbitrage trades based on the three currency pairs. This is where you can add your own calculation logic to determine the profit.

The `placeTrade()` function is responsible for executing the trades based on the identified currency pairs. This is where you would send orders to your broker.

The `createInterface()`, `setPreferredTimeframes()`, `selectCurrencies()`, `adjustParameters()`, `optimizeCode()`, `ensureCompatibility()`, and `testCompatibility()` functions are used to create a user-friendly interface, allow traders to set preferred timeframes and select currencies, adjust trading parameters, optimize code efficiency, ensure compatibility with trading platforms and APIs, and test compatibility with different environments.

The main entry point of the FCK Triangle EA is the `OnStart()` function. It initializes variables and settings, starts the EA by calling the necessary functions, and runs the triangular arbitrage strategy in a loop until the end time is reached. The strategy is executed every second using the `Sleep()` function.
